# C964 Capstone Project

## Project Summary

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to analyze and predict customer responses to a marketing campaign. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and data structures to provide insights and improve campaign efficiency.

### Key Components

1. **Data Processing**:
    - Parsed and cleaned data from the `campaign_responses.csv` file.
    - Converted raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis and modeling.

2. **Predictive Model**:
    - Implemented a machine learning model to predict customer responses.
    - Used Jupyter Notebook for developing and testing the model.
    - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.

3. **Insights and Analysis**:
    - Analyzed key factors influencing customer responses.
    - Provided actionable insights to optimize future marketing campaigns.

### Files and Documentation

- `campaign_responses.csv`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `campaignresponse_predictor.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `C964-Task2pdf.pdf`: Detailed documentation of the project, including methodology, results, and conclusions.

### Future Improvements

- Explore additional machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders.
- Conduct further analysis on additional datasets to generalize findings.
